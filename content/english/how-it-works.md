    title: "Get the knowledge that really gets you ahead"
    description: "Are you tired of standard lesson plans? We can understand that. There are so many interesting questions in the world, we don't need an assembly line program. We plan your goals with you and help you achieve them - per semester and per week. Learning happens automatically with the things that are important to you."

    title: "Inclusion inclusive"
    description: "Have you ever met two people who were 100% the same? Probably not. Then why should learning be 100% the same? Everyone has their own needs, goals and desires. With us, you can be who you are. And if you need special help, we are happy to support you. This automatically makes us inclusive."

    title: "Find your own diversity"
    description: "Online learning doesn't just mean video conferencing. Our challenges are as diverse as our learners. The learning groups meet regularly online and then work very differently - alone, in groups, with materials or outside."
